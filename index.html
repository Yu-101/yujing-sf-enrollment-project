    <h2>Welcome to Clean Oceans, Clean Future</h2>
<p>
The ocean is one of the most important parts of Earth. It supplies more than
50% of the oxygen we breathe, supports millions of marine species, regulates our
planet’s temperature, and provides food for billions of people. Unfortunately,
human activities such as plastic pollution, overfishing, and chemical waste
have put our oceans at great risk.
</p>

<p>
This website supports <b>United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14
(Life Below Water)</b>, which aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans,
seas, and marine resources. Through this website, you’ll learn about the causes 
of ocean pollution, their impacts on marine life, and what we can do as global 
citizens to protect the ocean for future generations.
</p>

<p>
Together, we can take action to build a cleaner and healthier ocean — and a 
cleaner future for everyone.

<h2>Main Causes of Ocean Pollution</h2>

<p>
Ocean pollution comes from many different human activities. These are the major
reasons our oceans are suffering today:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>1. Plastic Waste:</b> Every year, more than 8 million tons of plastic
      enter the ocean. Items like plastic bags, bottles, straws, and fishing nets
      break down into microplastics that are eaten by fish, turtles, and even 
      tiny plankton.</li><br>

  <li><b>2. Oil Spills:</b> When oil tankers leak or industries dump waste
      illegally, oil forms a thick layer on the water surface. This blocks
      sunlight, harms birds, suffocates fish, and destroys coral reefs.</li><br>

  <li><b>3. Chemical Pollution:</b> Factories, farms, and households release
      harmful substances such as pesticides, fertilizers, detergents, and heavy
      metals. These chemicals reduce water quality and can poison marine
      organisms.</li><br>

  <li><b>4. Overfishing:</b> Humans are catching fish faster than they can
      reproduce. This causes fish populations to collapse and disturbs the
      balance of marine ecosystems. Some species are now endangered because of
      this.</li><br>
</ul>

<p>
If these issues continue, our oceans may not be able to support life as they do
today. This is why SDG 14 is extremely important.
</p>

    </ul>

<h2>What Can We Do?</h2>

<p>
Although ocean pollution is a serious global issue, the good news is that all of
us — students, families, and communities — can take meaningful action to protect
the ocean. Here are some solutions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Reduce Single-Use Plastics:</b> Bring your own reusable bag, water
      bottle, and container. Avoid items like plastic straws and cutlery.</li><br>

  <li><b>Recycle Properly:</b> Learn how to sort recyclable materials correctly.
      Proper recycling reduces the amount of waste that ends up in the ocean.</li><br>

  <li><b>Join Beach Clean-Ups:</b> This is an easy and fun activity for students.
      Every small piece of trash collected helps prevent marine animals from
      eating it.</li><br>

  <li><b>Support Sustainable Seafood:</b> Choose seafood that is harvested
      responsibly. This helps protect fish populations and marine biodiversity.</li><br>

  <li><b>Spread Awareness:</b> Share information with friends, families, or your
      school community. The more people know, the more actions can be taken.</li><br>

  <li><b>Reduce Chemical Use:</b> Use eco-friendly cleaning products and avoid
      throwing paint or oil into drains, which can lead to the ocean.</li><br>
</ol>

<p>
Protecting the ocean starts with small choices — and your action matters.
