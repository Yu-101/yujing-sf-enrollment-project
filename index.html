        <h2>Welcome to Clean Oceans, Clean Future</h2>
            <p>
            The ocean is one of the most important parts of Earth. It supplies more than
            50% of the oxygen we breathe, supports millions of marine species, regulates our
            planet’s temperature, and provides food for billions of people. Unfortunately,
            human activities such as plastic pollution, overfishing, and chemical waste
            have put our oceans at great risk.

            This website supports <b>United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14
            (Life Below Water)</b>, which aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans,
            seas, and marine resources. Through this website, you’ll learn about the causes 
            of ocean pollution, their impacts on marine life, and what we can do as global 
            citizens to protect the ocean for future generations.

            Together, we can take action to build a cleaner and healthier ocean — and a 
            cleaner future for everyone.
